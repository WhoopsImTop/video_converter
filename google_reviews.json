Found this Hairstudio through instagram and man did they not disappoint. The atmosphere was welcoming as soon as I got in, I felt relaxed and at home. Everyone was so professional and I knew I would be in good hands. My haircut came out a 10/10. I’m very grateful. This will be my barbershop for now on every time I’m here in Freiburg.","time":1708035945,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Shin-ichiro Hiraga","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108391859982825358942/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIsmnO2eHGXKV3Aedlu-zdmd5ThblYjsr-ENNhsPpBU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"10 months ago","text":"This was my first haircut in Germany.\nMohammad Hakra's skills are excellent.
